# Deploying a High-availability web app using CloudFormation

In this project, we deploy an Apache Web Server using CloudFormation script.

This script creates and deploys the infrastructure and application, which (as of July 7th 2019, 05:00 EST) you can access here at the url of the servers' Load Balancer: [http://proje-WebAp-1A3SYXEU71DHF-1046738278.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com](https://proje-WebAp-1A3SYXEU71DHF-1046738278.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com)

Included is the diagram that helps visualizes that script.
Since it's an image file, to view the .png file you can just simply click on the file name on this page: [https://github.com/call900913/dend-rchristy-project2](https://github.com/call900913/dend-rchristy-project2).

The other file, `dend-rchristy-project2.yml`, is the CloudFormation script used to create the stack in question.

Cheers!
